# DLL Scanner - GitHub Copilot Instructions

**ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Before ANY commit or report_progress call, you MUST run: `black src/ tests/`**

Always reference these instructions first and fallback to search or bash commands only when you encounter unexpected information that does not match the info here.

> **Note**: This project is configured to use the `#codebase` semantic search tool by default for all GitHub Copilot interactions. This configuration is enforced through the `.github/copilot.yml` file.

DLL Scanner is a powerful Python tool for scanning directories to find DLL files, extracting comprehensive metadata, and performing static code analysis to confirm dependencies. The tool supports Windows DLL scanning functionality but maintains cross-platform compatibility for development and testing.

## Working Effectively

### Bootstrap, Build, and Test the Repository

**NEVER CANCEL any of these commands - builds and tests may take several minutes:**

- Set up development environment: `pip install -e ".[dev]"` -- takes 1-2 minutes to install all dependencies
- **Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`** -- ensures automatic formatting on commits (recommended but may fail in CI environments)
- Run tests: `pytest tests/ -v` -- takes ~5 seconds. NEVER CANCEL - set timeout to 30+ seconds for safety
- Run tests with coverage: `pytest tests/ -v --cov=dll_scanner --cov-report=term-missing` -- takes ~5 seconds
- Format code: `black src/ tests/` -- takes <1 second
- Check formatting: `black --check src/ tests/` -- takes <1 second 
- Lint code: `flake8 src/ tests/ --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503` -- takes <1 second
- Type checking: `mypy src/dll_scanner --ignore-missing-imports` -- takes ~4 seconds
- Build package: `python -m build` -- **WARNING: May fail due to network timeouts in CI environments. This is normal.**

### Run the Application

**CLI Commands:**
- Help: `dll-scanner --help`
- Version: `dll-scanner --version`
- Scan directory: `dll-scanner scan /path/to/directory`
- Scan with output: `dll-scanner scan /path/to/directory --output results.json`
- Scan with CycloneDX SBOM: `dll-scanner scan /path/to/directory --cyclonedx --output sbom.json`
- Inspect single DLL: `dll-scanner inspect path/to/file.dll`
- Inspect with output: `dll-scanner inspect path/to/file.dll --output metadata.json`
- Analyze dependencies: `dll-scanner scan /path/to/dlls --analyze-dependencies --source-dir /path/to/source`
- Standalone dependency analysis: `dll-scanner analyze /path/to/source library1.dll library2.dll`
- Command help: `dll-scanner COMMAND --help` (for any command)

**Python API:**
```python
from dll_scanner import DLLScanner, DependencyAnalyzer
from pathlib import Path

# Basic scanning
scanner = DLLScanner()
result = scanner.scan_directory(Path("/path/to/directory"))

# Dependency analysis  
analyzer = DependencyAnalyzer()
analysis_results = analyzer.analyze_dependencies(
    Path("/path/to/source"), 
    ["library.dll"]
)
```

## Validation

**MANDATORY: Always format code before any commit or report_progress call:**
```bash
# Format code automatically (REQUIRED before every commit)
black src/ tests/

# Alternative: Use the format check script
./scripts/format-check.sh  # Check formatting only
```

**ALWAYS run these quality checks before committing:**
- `black src/ tests/` -- format code (MANDATORY - must be run first)
- `flake8 src/ tests/ --max-line-length=88 --extend-ignore=E203,W503` -- lint code
- `mypy src/dll_scanner --ignore-missing-imports` -- type checking
- `pytest tests/ -v --cov=dll_scanner` -- run tests with coverage

**Pre-commit Formatting Rule:** 
- You MUST run `black src/ tests/` immediately before every `report_progress` call
- This ensures all committed code is properly formatted and passes CI checks
- Never skip this step, even for small changes
- Use `./scripts/format-check.sh` to verify formatting without making changes

**Manual Testing Scenarios:**
After making changes, ALWAYS test at least one complete end-to-end scenario:

1. **Basic Scanning Test:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/test_dll_dir
   echo "fake dll content" > /tmp/test_dll_dir/test.dll
   dll-scanner scan /tmp/test_dll_dir
   # Expected: Shows table with 1 DLL file found, architecture "Unknown"
   ```

2. **Dependency Analysis Test:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/test_source
   cat > /tmp/test_source/main.cpp << 'EOF'
   #include <windows.h>
   int main() {
       HMODULE handle = LoadLibrary("test.dll");
       return 0;
   }
   EOF
   dll-scanner scan /tmp/test_dll_dir --analyze-dependencies --source-dir /tmp/test_source
   # Expected: Shows dependency analysis with 1 confirmed dependency found
   ```

3. **JSON Output Test:**
   ```bash
   dll-scanner scan /tmp/test_dll_dir --output /tmp/results.json
   cat /tmp/results.json  # Verify JSON is valid and contains expected fields
   # Expected: Valid JSON with scan_path, total_dlls_found, dll_files array
   ```

4. **CycloneDX SBOM Test:**
   ```bash
   dll-scanner scan /tmp/test_dll_dir --cyclonedx --output /tmp/sbom.json
   head -20 /tmp/sbom.json  # Verify SBOM format
   # Expected: Valid CycloneDX JSON with components and metadata
   ```

5. **Inspect Command Test:**
   ```bash
   dll-scanner inspect /tmp/test_dll_dir/test.dll
   # Expected: Shows detailed metadata panel for the DLL file
   ```

6. **Python API Test:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   from dll_scanner import DLLScanner, DependencyAnalyzer
   from pathlib import Path
   scanner = DLLScanner()
   result = scanner.scan_directory(Path('/tmp/test_dll_dir'))
   print(f'Found {len(result.dll_files)} DLL files')
   "
   # Expected: Prints "Found 1 DLL files"
   ```

## Common Tasks

### Repository Structure
src/dll_scanner/ - Main source code with CLI, scanner, metadata extraction, dependency analysis
tests/ - Test suite (pytest, runs in ~5 seconds)
.github/workflows/ - CI/CD (ci.yml for testing, publish.yml for PyPI)
pyproject.toml - Project config, dependencies, build settings
examples/test_usage.sh - Working example script for testing CLI

### Key Files for Development
- `src/dll_scanner/cli.py` - Command-line interface (main entry point)
- `src/dll_scanner/scanner.py` - Core DLL scanning logic
- `src/dll_scanner/metadata.py` - PE metadata extraction
- `src/dll_scanner/analyzer.py` - Dependency analysis engine
- `tests/test_dll_scanner.py` - Comprehensive test coverage

### Common Issues and Solutions
- **Build fails with network timeouts (HTTPSConnectionPool timeout):** This is common in CI environments due to PyPI network issues. The build will work locally or when network is stable. Do not rely on `python -m build` for validation - use the installed package instead.
- **"pefile library is required" errors:** Install with `pip install pefile` (should be automatic with dev install)
- **Permission denied errors:** Run as administrator or ensure read permissions for target directory
- **ImportError with optional dependencies:** Install dev dependencies with `pip install -e ".[dev]"`
- **Analysis errors with fake DLL files:** This is expected - fake DLL files will show "PE analysis failed" but the tool will still process them
- **flake8 linting errors:** The codebase has some existing linting issues in cli.py and cyclonedx_exporter.py - these are known issues and do not prevent functionality

### Performance Tips
- Use `--max-workers` to control memory usage vs. speed trade-off
- Disable `--parallel` for very large numbers of small files
- Use `--no-recursive` when only scanning the target directory (not subdirectories)

### Testing Notes
- Tests are designed to work without real DLL files using mocking
- One integration test is skipped that requires actual DLL files
- Full test suite runs in ~5 seconds
- Test coverage is maintained at high levels across all modules
